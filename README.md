# Simplified iOS Utilities

This is a collection of utilities used at NYPL in the [Simplified](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified) suite of products and code bases for iOS.

## Objectives

- Generality: the classes and functions should be general-purpose enough to be used independently of the product they are used in.
- Absolutely no third party dependencies: we want to be able to use this module anywhere without any additional requirements.
- Testability: every utility should be easily unit-testable.

## Requirements

- Xcode 13
- iOS 10+
- Swift 5

## Integration

The only supported way for integrating this project is by using Swift Package Manager. The Xcode project is deprecated.
